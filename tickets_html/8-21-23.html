                <p>Hey bambi, it was for being toxic. You got a mod message warning to stop, and your first words when you started playing were "ur bad". There was a lot more after that message that spanned multiple games where you just blamed and complained about your team calling them out for really no reason.</p>

                <p>Did you report this player? If not, we don't know who to look at for chat. You're actively picking up many reports for chat and other things, this is why we keep looking at your account. You got a mod warning message, and proceeded to ignore it entirely. If you remember this player who called your horse shit, I can check on their chat logs, but if it's a one-off message, chances are we won't mute for it. If it's continuous toxicity, we can warn them via in game messages or mod messages, and if they continue to be toxic, we will mute them just like we did for you.</p>

                <p>Everyone has their own standards for "toxicity", obviously there is no universal line to draw that everyone would agree on. Messages like telling someone to kill themselves result in instant removal of chat whereas things like calling people "shit" usually require a bit more context or repetition. It was not any single message that led to your mute, it was the trend of your chat which was not improving despite warnings to ease up. </p>
<p>The same rules apply for others. If you were to call someone "horse shit" once in a blue moon, chances are you won't be muted, though it really depends on the bigger picture. Are you calling the same person "horse shit" every time you see them? Are you intentionally trying to do it to get away with it by only doing it once in a blue moon? Was it more of a "heat of the moment" kind of thing? ect. There's a lot of factors that go into it, but continuing the same type of chat you were just warned for is a pretty good way to get muted quicker.</p>

                <p>Hello i appreciate the time and effort you put into the community, However i feel this is an unfair mute. I received your warning and i did adjust my chat to be less toxic. Most of what i was saying was helpful and informative however you would have to see the full context and the game to understand. I would like to discuss in more detail each chat message so i can explain myself.<br />
From what i remember i said no team once at the end of the game because the heat of the moment. but besides that I was saying "pls" or "nice" when someone flaccid grabbed or did something obviously wrong. and i called a few people bad because they were saying something to me in chat that did not make sense at all and i did not have time to explain to them. I also gave a few tips that may have come across as toxic because of how obvious they were. But if you would take the time to  go over them with me i will explain further. I do not want this mute on my profile because i will get muted longer next time because of this. </p>
