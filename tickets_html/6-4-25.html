                <p>What some may call theatrics are what others call pleasantries. I apologize for calling you a moron yesterday. And for saying mods smell. I go through a lot of mood swings throughout the day, I don't think you are morons and wish you all a good rest of your day. I will take these next5 months to try and improve my mood swings to at least not do something i will later have to apologize for.  </p>

                <p>Here are some interactions from your previous bans from earlier this year:</p>
<p>Anne Frank: I've talked it over with the other mods. The plan is to unban you Friday around 10pm (5 days for the ban), then convert it to a mute at that time. This will be your 9th mute. Also, if you get banned again, do not evade the ban for any reason please. If you do so the longer 6 month ban will not be reduced.</p>
<p>From another appeal:</p>
<p>Bambi: well either unban or smurf. i'm tired of this bs banning everytime i try to play for more than a few hours.</p>
<p>Bambi: i got a new computer and a vpn ready for this exact moment fuck your dumbass bans. 6 months cuz 8 idiots report me. dumb as fuck.</p>
<p>Bambi: I want to keep my Bambi account and would prefer not to go through the hassle of creating a smurf account especially if there's a chance I'll be unbanned. That said, I'm not willing to wait six months just to play again.</p>
<p>Bambi: I'm just gonna Smurf since you won't give me a straight answer</p>
<p>And here's the link to your most recent actual appeal: <a href="https://support.koalabeast.com/tickets/b5dd160e-cab1-4a28-9baf-798c1b557aac">https://support.koalabeast.com/tickets/b5dd160e-cab1-4a28-9baf-798c1b557aac</a></p>
<p>It was made very clear that any evasion would mean you're ban would not be reduced. Since then you've repeatedly said you're just going to VPN and smurf to evade. Even if that was an empty threat, it was a terrible decision to say something like that when you've been warned against it in the past.</p>
<p>Even without those lines about you smurfing and continuing to play, the mod team's thoughts on your ban have not changed since that appeal, we have no plans to unban you. Every time we do, you end up right back here shortly after. The short bans seem to do absolutely nothing to change your behavior in game. You still fail to take accountability for your actions and blame everything else you can think of, and we don't feel that unbanning you early will be any different this time.</p>
<p>There is nothing else to be said.</p>

                <p>It wasn't an empty threat. I am saying that i will smurf in protest of the unreasonably long ban. But i have been holding off because i still want to try to get unbanned. I understand the error of my ways this ban. I actually was waoting so I probably deserve this ban but the only reason it is 6 months is because of all the previous bans that were not in any way justified. I didn't waot for any of the previous bans and you always unbanned me shortly after because it was clear I was not waoting. I am just asking for the 6 month ban to be shortened to 3 months. I am someone who gets a lot of reports because of the odd way that i play and when I do play i tend to play for a lot of hours in a day so it just makes sense that i would get 8 reports often. I do deeply regret waoting for this ban but I was extremely tilted. </p>
