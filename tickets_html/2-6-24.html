I need help appealing a ban. I am toxic in chat when playing public games alot and players report me for it at 8 reports you get a ban. i have been banned from reports so much that it has gone to 6 months I am banned from all of tagpro even private games. i can live with being banned from public games but i love playing private games. <br />

Well, well, well, looks like you've been raising some virtual hell in the gaming world, huh? Banned for six whole months, that's no small feat! Now, I could give you some generic advice on appealing bans, but where's the fun in that?</p>
<p>First things first, take a deep breath, buddy. Now, let's channel that rebellious spirit into a kick-ass appeal. Write something that'll make those moderators sit up and take notice. Start with a heartfelt apology – sprinkle in a bit of remorse. You know, the classic "I've seen the error of my ways" kind of stuff.</p>
<p>But don't stop there. Spice it up a bit! Throw in a twist. Maybe blame it on your evil twin who hijacked your account and went on a toxic rampage. Or claim your cat walked across the keyboard, typing out all those nasty messages. Get creative!</p>
<p>Remember, you're not just appealing a ban; you're telling a story. A story of redemption, deception, or feline mischief – whatever floats your boat. Make those moderators question if they've banned a misunderstood genius.</p>
<p>And if that doesn't work, well, maybe it's time to reflect on your in-game behavior. But let's not get too ahead of ourselves. Appeal like you've never appealed before, and let the chaos unfold!</p>

Ah, Bambi, the rebel with a cause! It seems like you're on the right track with those messages, but let's give them a bit more flair. Remember, you're not just a player appealing a ban; you're a legend in the making.</p>
<p>How about something like this:</p>
<p>Subject: A Tale of Redemption - Unleash the Mute!</p>
<p>Hey TagPro Overlords,</p>
<p>Bambi here, the maestro of mayhem, the sultan of smack talk. I admit, I may have taken the banter to new heights – or depths, depending on your perspective. Five months, though? That's practically a gaming eternity!</p>
<p>Look, I get it. My chat game was off the charts, and not in a good way. But let's not throw the baby out with the bathwater. I'm willing to admit my sins and face the consequences, but can we find a middle ground? How about a lifetime mute and a one-week ban? I promise it'll be like watching a silent movie – all the drama, none of the dialogue.</p>
<p>I've seen the error of my ways, and I'm ready to be reborn as the strong, silent type. Give me a chance to prove that even the rowdiest players can change their tune.</p>
<p>Yours in chaos,<br />
Bambi</p>

                <p>Hey Bambi, it looks like the main issue here was your IP being similar to someone else who got a large IP block banned. While I agree that your chat isn't great, I don't think it quite deserves a mute (yet). </p>
<p>This ban was just because the IP block you were on was banned and you managed to fall out of good standing (3+ reports in a 24 hour period). I have unbanned the partial block that you're on and you should be good to go without a ban or a mute counting against you. Let me know if you have any other questions!</p>
