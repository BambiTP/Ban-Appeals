<p>Looking back at your last appeal, Cheeze graciously went ahead and removed your 6 month ban because you promised you were going to work on the exact same thing I just banned you for, risky plays with low reward. Here's what he said if you needed a refresher: "I've gone back and reviewed all of your waot reports, of which you earned 8 in just 8 hours, and I don't understand how many times you need to hear the same thing for it to start making sense. Intentionally making high risk plays that might work out is not good for your team, it is not excused because there was a 1% chance of it working, and it does not matter what your teammates did to support your attempt or not when deciding who is at fault. Your decision making is intentional, it is consistent, and it detracts from the experience of the rest of the lobby every single time. You are on a team, you are one of four players, if you cannot play with that understanding you are not going to see any improvement in this problem."</p>
<p>Neither of the things you promised in the appeal have come to fruition, keeping your chat "strictly positive" and also "keeping your reports to a minimum"</p>

                <p>Bambi,</p>
<p>Being hyperfixated on a backdoor cap and increasing your hold time, which effectively abandons your teammates, is eerily similar to the many bans you have already received. As Cheeze explained in your last ban appeal, these high-risk plays that have a small chance of working are negatively impacting your teammates and derailing games. At this time, all moderators that have had input on this game have believed that it is a ban. </p>
<p>Moving on. It has only been one month since Cheeze removed your previous ban. Which puts us in a pretty difficult situation regarding the ban length. Jumping back to the previous appeal again, do you believe that any progress has been made in your chat and conduct? I acknowledge that paths forward are rarely straight and narrow so I would appreciate your input.</p>
<p>Best,<br />
Burt</p>

                <p>i thought it was a good strat that had a good chance of working with low risk.  the only other 2nf map i have played was juketown and the only way they could cap was if both flag attack at once. i thought this map was similar. if all 4 try to cap with the one flag i cap with our flag. if not it's pretty unlikely they cap. and i tried to set up attacks where we both attack their base at the same time but it was never there. i still think this strat has merit but i made too many mistakes. just didn't have enough experience to pull it off</p>

                <p>I am pretty open to a ban reduction but will need to discuss this with the other moderators. In the future, I think it would be beneficial to mindfully pick your spots when attempting new strategies and evaluate on the fly if they are working or not. I highly recommend not implementing them for an entire game.</p>

honestly that game would be pretty hard to win given the players in the lobby against and on bambi's team<br />
still doesn't excuse the bad plays though, don't think they were with malicious intent but they were still pretty bad nevertheless</p>

Bambi essentially got banned for being dumb</p>

Idk - not everyone plays the game the same way or has the same priorities in game. Pubs are for having fun. There’s leagues and tpm if you want to play competitive games.<br />
I play pubs to unwind and I like playing offense - I don’t always make the correct strategic choice in pubs bc it’s a fucking pub. I just wanna go grab the flag and try to get a crazy cap. So am I going to leave solo D and not give two fucks? Sometimes, yeah, I probably will.<br />
Also, I’m going to type in pubs. Pubs are very low stakes games - my priority is fun in pubs. People get bent out of shape too much when you don’t play optimally in pubs..<br />
Trying to get 6 minutes of hold is a perfectly valid pub activity<br />
As is typing shit at the person trying to get 6 minutes of hold<br />
I remember back in the day trying to get 5 caps. If I got the first two caps I would look for an opportunity to switch teams to try for three more. That’s not the optimal strategy, but it was fun af and I was super pumped when I finally accomplished it</p>

Bambi did nothing wrong</p>
<p>FatBootyDion — 10/04/2024 1:26 PM<br />
I'm not really sure what you are asking. We believed he was playing with malicious intent.</p>
<p>BertAndBort — 10/04/2024 1:26 PM<br />
malicious against his teammates?<br />
on what basis?</p>
<p>FatBootyDion — 10/04/2024 1:26 PM<br />
not trying to cap</p>
<p>BertAndBort — 10/04/2024 1:27 PM<br />
he specifically does try to take some capping lanes when they open<br />
not well, but its very clear</p>
<p>BertAndBort — 10/04/2024 1:28 PM<br />
its true that itll irritate his teammates because pubbers are impatient, maybe he even knew that? but malicious is</p>
<p>BertAndBort — 10/04/2024 1:28 PM<br />
way outta line</p>

i don't think it's a good strat, just not really waoting</p>

Not following the meta shouldn't be bannable. Bambis strategy was viable</p>
<p>True Novice Ball — 10/04/2024 12:54 PM<br />
jig legit p much only plays tpm and league, bambi is on tpm every night doing bambi things and jig has to not only deal with tpm reports but also actively playing in bambi games</p>
<p>True Novice Ball — 10/04/2024 12:54 PM<br />
you get a bunch of reports for some games bambi played<br />
youre gonna probably just ban bambi</p>
<p>LogisticMap — 10/04/2024 12:50 PM<br />
don't really think these games are bannable unless you think the endings were malicious versus stupidity </p>

I don't know what else you want me to say. I wasn't being malicious I was just being dumb. I barely know how to play regular nf let alone 2nf. My brain is just different. If I thought at any point during that game that there was a possibility of me getting banned for playing like that I would have left the game entirely. </p>

                <p>Hi Bambi,</p>
<p>This has taken some time to properly review. Not because the case is terribly complicated but because the context makes this challenging to approach. </p>
<p>In your last appeal, around 6 weeks ago, you said the following to me with your promise that we would be seeing a 'new you' in public games:</p>
<p>&gt; When I make mistakes, I think a part of me is afraid that others will call me bad, so I try to beat them to the punch by calling them bad first. This cycle has made me reluctant to grow and has given me a false superiority complex that's been damaging to myself and the community. Which is especially bad since it makes me feel like I can never be wrong, when we both know I'm wrong all the time.</p>
<p>I really liked this line. It showed some good insight towards the drivers behind your pub persona and it gave me some hope that you would be able to turn a new leaf and start interacting positively with your gameplay following suit. </p>
<p>Looking back now and remembering this line, I am especially disheartened to see the mute earned just before this ban for spamming "classic someball" when logged out players made mistakes in games you were playing. This seems to be a direct regression into the behavior that earned the previous ban followed quickly by the complimenting ban of its own that we are stuck here discussing now. </p>
<p>I am less concerned than the rest of the mod team about your gameplay on Leningrad. I found your gumbo gameplay to be a stronger indicator of malice than the failed holding approach was, but your immediate reactions following this ban point more towards you being fully aware that this was not a winning strategy and choosing to double down regardless. You said yourself a few messages ago, "I wasn't being malicious I was just being dumb". Why is this something you think to say now but not something that you are able to work into a new strategy you are trying for the first time? And why then is the burden of working around you "just being dumb" falling on other players? And if you don't have an answer to either of these questions, what are you doing to improve this trend and how are you measuring progress because I don't see much from the last appeal to now.</p>
<p>The bottom line for these bans is us doing what we can to maintain an enjoyable public game environment. Players are allowed to make mistakes and within reason they can try new strategies, but when both of those events meet together and instead of learning from them you are doubling down on them, how are we supposed to trust that you can go back to playing public games again? You spent several games chirping logged out players, many of whom were in their first months playing the game, only to turn around and commit intentional mistakes with larger implications for the outcome of the game. That is a bad look no matter how you frame it even without the context of your provisional unbanning not 2 months ago and with that context... it's hard to see any trustworthy resolution here.</p>
<p>Take your time to read through this message and answer all of the questions, then answer this last one please:<br />
Why are public games better off with you in them than with you out of them?</p>
