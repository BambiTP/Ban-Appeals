If i had chat on i would have left the first game and not had to play with him anymore.</p>

                <p>Hi Bambi,</p>
<p>I've gone back and reviewed all of your waot reports, of which you earned 8 in just 8 hours, and I don't understand how many times you need to hear the same thing for it to start making sense. Intentionally making high risk plays that <em>might</em> work out is not good for your team, it is not excused because there was a 1% chance of it working, and it does not matter what your teammates did to support your attempt or not when deciding who is at fault. Your decision making is intentional, it is consistent, and it detracts from the experience of the rest of the lobby every single time. You are on a team, you are one of four players, if you cannot play with that understanding you are not going to see any improvement in this problem.</p>
<p>I have also gone back and reviewed the past 56 community bans earned. You are one of only 3 to earn 8 waot reports in a day from that pool and each of the other two were blatant cases of walking back into the endzone to give up captures over multiple games. To be earning these reports at the frequency that you do is not a TagPro problem, it is not a pub problem, it is not a meta problem or a mentality problem, it is a <em>you</em> problem that is not going to get better until you stop trying to shift the blame off of yourself and revisit what it is you are trying to accomplish when you play the game.</p>
<p>So now I need to figure out what to do with this 6 month ban. Applying for ban decay likely won't change the length. You have used your second chance already (and promised you wouldn't be banned for a year if you were muted...)<br />
<a href="https://bambitp.github.io/Ban-Appeals/tickets_html/3-22-24.html">https://bambitp.github.io/Ban-Appeals/tickets_html/3-22-24.html</a><br />
I'm really at a loss for how to give you any leeway here. What is going to change? What will be different from the 14 bans before this one where there was no improvement after the ban? 6 month bans only exist because anyone getting that high in the ban count has shown that they aren't capable of improving their conduct and so the best we can do is just keep them out of pubs for a while in the hopes that something changes by the time they get back, what can you do to prove that you don't belong in that category? How do we measure progress? Lay all that out for me and we can talk about the length of this ban but if you blame someone else for anything I will be closing this ticket.</p>

                <p>Ban me from pubs and let me play group games. I don't like pubs anyways. <br />
I would bet most of those reports are in nf, I never liked nf because it too team reliant I try to do as much as possible without relying on my team but i am not good enough yet. There are spurts where I can carry nf games without needing any help from my teammates but i can't do it consistently yet.</p>

                <p>I've done a lot of self-reflecting the past couple days. First of all thank you for being so patient with me. Scrolling up and seeing all of the nonsense I typed at you is embarrassing so sorry for that. I talked to a lot of different people about my flaws and the way I play and uncovered some hard truths. I'm a bad teammate. I'm stubborn, petty, and quick to blame everyone around me while deflecting any criticism coming my way. I'm dismissive of the plays my team goes for and always think I know better than them, even when that's not the case. Idk if it's intentional, but I fail to see the big picture in my games and fall into playing as an individual, and blame my team if they do something I don't like. When I make mistakes, I think a part of me is afraid that others will call me bad, so I try to beat them to the punch by calling them bad first. This cycle has made me reluctant to grow and has given me a false superiority complex that's been damaging to myself and the community. Which is especially bad since it makes me feel like I can never be wrong, when we both know I'm wrong all the time. Thank you again for taking your time to talk to me even after how I've been acting. I hope you can shorten my ban, but if not I understand. I don't just want to play competitive. I want to come back to pubs as soon as I can and show people a new Bambi. I want people to see a better me and be someone they're excited to play with, not someone who will blame them, play poorly, and ruin their experience. I know it might be difficult to make and maintain these changes over a few days, but I want this to be an ongoing process where I continue to improve and take feedback as a person. Thanks.</p>

                <p>Hi Bambi, thank you for your own patience, I apologize for my delayed response. </p>
<p>Thank you for taking the time to write this up, it is good to see that you were able to work on this with some other members of the community. You have mentioned some important trends/themes with your conduct that I agree can be improved. Before discussing length or removal of this ban, I would like us to come up with some plan to check in on how you are handling things short-term and a way measure progress as I mentioned in my last message. Do you have any ideas I can pull from to apply to something like that? I get concerned seeing messages like yours in here while concurrently reading messages about creating smurf accounts or evading. If we can pick a day to check in and compare pre and post ban conduct for similarities and differences it would help me understand that you mean what you are saying. </p>

                <p>Hi Cheeze thanks again for giving me the chance to appeal even after everything i said at the beginning of the ticket. Some ways i can think of for measuring progress is a provisional unban where I play pubs for a week or so while keeping my reports to the minimum.<br />
And maybe during the provisional unban period I can be unmuted and keep my chats strictly positive.<br />
As for my smurf comments, I was trolling there in discord, sorry about that. I would never smurf and don't even know how to.<br />
Thanks for giving me another shot. Also any day will work to compare pre and post ban conduct<br />

                <p>Hi Bambi,</p>
<p>That sounds like a realistic enough approach for me. I am going to remove the ban and mutes on your account. You are to stay logged in when you play and I will be checking in on your chat to make sure you are holding true to our conversation and to make sure that you are not being unfairly targeted by others in the community for prior offenses. If I see an uptick in reports on your account I will be reaching out on discord to see if we can figure out what might be causing that and fine tune our approach from there. </p>
<p>Please let us know if you have any questions,</p>
