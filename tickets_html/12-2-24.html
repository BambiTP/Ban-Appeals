                <p>I want to appeal my ban again. Yes I have been evading my ban and I will continue to do so. Only because this ban is unfair I didn't break any rules and I didn't even get reported 8 times. I was banned by jig for some bs reason. Most of the people who saw the replay said I shouldn't have been banned this is my one final attempt to appeal. I never waoted a single time but now under the anonymity on a someball and a vpn and the constant accusations of waoting It makes me want to waot </p>

<p>Please review your previous appeal and feel free to begin where it left off. Continuing to evade will continue to reset the timer on this 6 month ban and increase your ban total, which is currently up to 24.<br />

                <p>My reply to the last message is I still think the gumbo and leningrad and whatever other game i got banned for should not be bannable. Sure it is not adhering to the "meta" completely but i was still trying to win. And the Classic Someballs spam is regrettable. It wasn't exclusively targeted at logged out players even though i am saying someballs. It was more for all the mistakes I saw. I would say it when the other team makes a mistake and would even say it when i made a mistake but looking back it was in bad taste. </p>
<p>That being said though if i was unbanned i wouldn't ever deviate from the meta ever again I will probably just leave the next 2nf game or any map with a strange gimmick because there is no meta yet. And i will take the saying "if you don't have anything nice to say don't say anything at all"to heart.  and would probably limit myself to 3-4 games a day.</p>
<p>"why then is the burden of working around you "just being dumb" falling on other players"</p>
<p>I mean sure I was being dumb but only in the context of me being easily banned. I still think my strategy was a winning strategy. </p>
<p>"Why are public games better off with you in them than with you out of them?"</p>
<p>This question is dumb and is the reason i didn't reply to the previous message. i could care less who are in my games. there aren't many people who make public games better. Maybe you could argue Freakball or some other person that has full conversation mid game makes public games better but i would argue not because he types too much and doesn't focus on the game. For me players like jig maelstrom neu and jkooter make public games better because of their focus on the game and their skill. but others would disagree and say they make it worse because they are too good. at the end of the day we are all just balls playing tagpro and trying to either pass the time, have fun or sharpen our skills. <br />
I pub to pass the time and to try to improve my mechanics for comp and tpm and i likely won't pub anymore since i can get banned so easily it's simply not worth it. Getting banned is never on my radar until the moment it happens but I will not make that mistake again i will play every pub with the intention of not getting banned. </p>
<p>Unless my ban get's shortened or removed i will not stop evading and will end up making a comp smurf account.<br />
This is not a unban me or else statement it's just what i will do because 6 months for trying a new strategy is absurd. </p>

                <p>Hello Cheezedoodle. I hope you can ignore the previous messages.</p>
<p>I am doing my final appeal. I have been thinking about this for a few days and am ready to write my thoughts now. I have said a million times that i wasn't purposefully trying to hurt my teams chances at winning and I think you believe me so I was forced to ask myself why you are not unbanning me. <br />
And that is pretty obvious it's because I didn't finish my last appeal ban evaded and then went back to the same excuses in this appeal. If i am being honest I didn't write a single word on my last successful appeal asap and beastmode wrote the whole thing. And i went to them again for this appeal and they told me to hold off on answering the final message you sent. I didn't understand why but I did for a while but eventually i gave up and decided that ban evading would be easier. It is easier but I want to play on my bambi account. well anyways I am writing this appeal completely alone with no outside assistance. </p>
<p>I guess we can start with the classic someballs macro like i said it is regrettable In the moment i didn't think it was all that bad but hindsight is 20/20 was a joke in bad taste. <br />
Next is the progress and working towards being a "better pubber"  I was making tiny goals in my head after i was unbanned. Normally i stopped playing if I was playing worse than a 50% win rate and tried not to play longer than ~ 2 hours at a time. and i was following that for practically the whole time until the day i got banned, I was at like 30-40% win rate all day and was playing well over 2 hours and i also skipped breakfast because I didn't want to stop playing. </p>
<p>And i am not going to say anything about the games I played besides i was not waoting.</p>

                <p>Hi bambi,</p>
<p>Thank you for taking the time to rewrite this appeal. I am aware of the fact that you did not write the previous one, and chose to overlook that at the time because it still accomplished my primary goal of having you to think about what you are doing from a perspective other than your own, even if only temporarily through someone else's voice. </p>
<p>That same theme is a piece of why the initial ban kickstarting this sequence was applied in the first place, and why I have not responded to any of your comments before these most recent few. I don't think you are a bad person, I do think that you care about TagPro and I do think that you have a place in this community, but I don't think you take enough time to reflect on and own your decisions or understand how those decisions might be impacting the people around you. </p>
<p>You've put down some thoughts here, more or less looking at things correctly, and I would like to highlight the line "i gave up and decided that ban evading would be easier". It is completely correct, popping on a VPN is a lot easier than stopping and thinking about what you are doing, why, and how to improve when you don't fully grasp what is going wrong. This is not something you can improve by taking the easy route on, TagPro or otherwise, and I sincerely want you to see improvement on this as a person even more so than as a player of our game.</p>
<p>With the initial ban of this sequence, the subsequent ban evasion, threats, and subreddit posts, I have enough to upgrade this to a permanent ban and never think about it again. That is <em>my</em> easy way out, my equivalent of popping on a VPN and ignoring the underlying issue. Instead I am sitting here in an airport on vacation trying to find ways for you and I to reach a realistic agreement to the benefit of each of us and the broader TagPro community. As such my decision is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Without help, you will answer the final question of your previous appeal "Why are public games better off with you in them than with you out of them?"</li>
<li>You will send me a list of any accounts you have created which are not currently banned</li>
<li>You will not play or attempt to play logged in or logged out until the end of this calendar year.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you can complete the above three steps, I will unban your TagPro accounts, remove your reddit and discord bans, and set your active ban count to 15 (down from the current 27). If you cannot complete these steps and once again choose the 'easy' route, the decision to permanently ban you from the community will be deferred to the rest of the mod team and there will be no further communication between us.</p>
<p>Please take your time and let me know if you have any questions,<br />
- Cheezedoodle</p>

                <p>Hi cheeze thanks for the patience.</p>
<p>"Why are public games better with me in them than with you out of them"<br />
I don't have a good answer to this, I'm not that good at the game and i don't really send positive vibes in the chat either. But I do try to answer any questions about events or what regrab is etc whenever people ask them. I also excel at certain skills in tagpro like blocking and grabbing and maybe someone sees a good play i make and takes inspiration and becomes better because of it. I also make gravity or hockey groups sometimes.</p>
<p>But all of those are kinda not really making pubs better all that much. the 2 biggest things i am kinda lacking in. But that can change I can't promise i can bring good vibes in chat but i can stop myself from bringing bad vibes. </p>
<p>And i think i am good enough to be an asset to our team instead of a liability most of the time. I don't know how i am going to stop the waot reports besides what i was doing before. And i've noticed they all come from nf games. I might just leave all the nf games I join never liked nf anyways. </p>
<p>So to answer the question - Public games were not better off with me in them than with me out of them but It should be easy to change that with a new attitude and better nf discipline... i think. </p>
<p>I don't have any accounts that are unbanned I haven't played since the day i taunted you in discord chat xD</p>
