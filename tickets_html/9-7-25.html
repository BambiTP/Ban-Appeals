                <p>I've come to acknowledge my faults, The ban I am currently serving my faults are obvious, I went afk at random moments during the game and played very greedily but this is not how I normally play I was just really tilted at ranked so this isn't a very good example to acknowledge my faults. My ban was only so long thanks to previous bans, and while I don't remember much of those bans at all I can probably make assumptions as to why someone would report someone and see if any of those situations correlate to my own. After some thought I could only think of one legitimate reason to report someone and that is if you think that they are trying to lose or at the very least not trying to win.</p>
<p>I think it comes down to my mindset of how I play any strategy game. When a situation gets bad I tend to get desperate be it in chess tagpro or any other game I try risky things to get the odds back on my side. But that alone probably isn't enough to warrant people reporting me. I suppose in the leadup to previous bans, I have treated teammates that i consider bad as obstacles rather than assets and mix that with being desperate and you get me killing teammates to reset the flag or pushing people off of re so they don't make the play worse. And even though I am trying to win the people who I am doing that to don't see it that way.</p>
<p>I see now that while I was often trying to win, the way I played made it seem like I wasn’t. By killing teammates or pushing them off positions, I wasn’t just taking risks, I actually made the situation worse for the people I was supposed to be working with. Even if those plays sometimes worked, they made pubs unenjoyable for my team. Going forward, I’ll focus on treating teammates as assets and allies instead of obstacles. That means trusting them more, playing around their mistakes instead of trying to prevent them, and avoiding actions that directly sabotage their experience. I hope you can approach my ban appeal with clemency and an open mind. Thank you</p>
<p>This was a lot longer but I trimmed a lot of it down for the readers pleasure.</p>

<p>I also wanted to add that another reason I may be viewing my teammates as obstacles rather than assets is because on defense I am rigid in the way I play and if my partner doesn't play that way I suck. So I try to get the flag in my hands at all cost because that is where I feel I am in the most control of the game.</p>

                <p>also how do you determine which bans are wrongful and which bans were shortened. I think I only had one shortened ban and the rest were lifted completely. Does lifting them completely count as shortening?</p>

                <p>Hi Bambi, I talked it over with the mods again to see if anyone's opinion had changed, and they hadn't. It still seems to boil down to this:</p>
<p>"Your appeals always seem to involve you making deals and promises you can't keep by continuing the behavior that gets you banned, I'm not sure why we'd believe you that things will be different after the first, second, third, fourh, etc. time you've said the same thing and nothing has changed."</p>
<p>Even seemingly genuine appeals like this you've had before and a month or two later, it all seems to regress. The mods and O have no plans to unban you early before this ban ends.</p>

                <p>I'm not making a deal I'm saying that I've changed. While I did say similar things before this time is different because it's been 4 months. I've learned my lesson and not being able to get better at the game for 4 months has been torture. I missed a season of MLTP and am going to miss another one. </p>
<p>I see no reason to keep the ban at 6 months since it will be no different than 4 months I am at the peak of what I will learn and I fear another 2 months and I will just regress into the opposite of the bans goal.</p>
