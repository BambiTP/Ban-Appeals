                <p>I am appealing my ban length. I understand that I was not playing to my full ability. I was afking because of my tilt and that could be considered waoting. However a 6 month ban is not warranted. I know that i have a lot of bans but I almost never server the full length of any of those bans. I was unbanned early because it was a wrongful ban and i believe those should not count towards my ban count. I think the longest ban i served was a 1 month ban which was also a wrongful ban probably but i still waited anyways. A jump from 1 month to 6 months is a bit steep. </p>

                <p>Hi Bambi, when bans are reversed for wrongful bans, they do not count against the player, they are entirely removed from their account. When bans are shortened from leniency, they do still count against the player as the bans weren't wrongful, just shortened. With that in mind you are at 16 bans with 7 of them occurring in the past year, 4 of which were from community bans. We receive maybe 1 community ban per week, and usually there's a bunch of system AFK's in that mix. None of your 4 had any system afk reports, and most of them were WAOT reports.</p>
<p>Just because you disagree with a ban, doesn't mean it's wrongful and shouldn't count against you. We still see no reason to shorten this ban, you clearly don't think you've done much wrong in the past as you still claim most of your bans were wrongful when they were not.</p>
<p>The jump from 1 month to 6 months is supposed to be steep, it's supposed to deter people from getting banned so much, at some point when players keep getting banned from ruining games, it's better to not have them in the games. This is a direct quote from cheeze in another appeal of yours:</p>
<p>"6 month bans only exist because anyone getting that high in the ban count has shown that they aren't capable of improving their conduct and so the best we can do is just keep them out of pubs for a while in the hopes that something changes by the time they get back".</p>
<p>Your appeals always seem to involve you making deals and promises you can't keep by continuing the behavior that gets you banned, I'm not sure why we'd believe you that things will be different after the first, second, third, fourh, etc. time you've said the same thing and nothing has changed.</p>
