                <p>Hi Bambi, we don't have any plans to unmute you at this time.</p>
<p>The info as to why you were muted has been given to you many times. The mute isn't for saying "classic someballs", it's for constantly harassing your teammates, this includes, but is not limited to, you spamming "classic someballs" when someone logged out makes a mistake. Regardless of your feeling towards someballs, this consistent harassing of people in chat has been a common trend with you.</p>
<p>Here's a few copy/pastes from previous appeals to further explain it:</p>
<p>"Everyone has their own standards for "toxicity", obviously there is no universal line to draw that everyone would agree on. Messages like telling someone to kill themselves result in instant removal of chat whereas things like calling people "shit" usually require a bit more context or repetition. It was not any single message that led to your mute, it was the trend of your chat which was not improving despite warnings to ease up. The same rules apply for others. If you were to call someone "horse shit" once in a blue moon, chances are you won't be muted, though it really depends on the bigger picture. Are you calling the same person "horse shit" every time you see them? Are you intentionally trying to do it to get away with it by only doing it once in a blue moon? Was it more of a "heat of the moment" kind of thing? ect. There's a lot of factors that go into it, but continuing the same type of chat you were just warned for is a pretty good way to get muted quicker."</p>

                <p>Oh yeah I remember now. Can I ask for my mute to be shortened then. It's one year when I thought it was like an increment thing. I wasn't muted that many times.</p>
<p>Also I said classic someballs even when I made a mistake. I was just using "Someballs" as a roast it wasn't really targeted at someballs. </p>

I remember asking to be muted for a year so I can chill out like a week or so before I got muted for something else. I have been muted for a long time and I don't think I was even supposed to get muted for that long. I have chilled out though now. I won't be toxic in chat anymore.</p>

                <p>I'll look into the full mute history and let you know. I should be able to update you tomorrow. I know your history is a bit wonky with some long bans/mutes, but I'll make sure everything is correct and then determine on where to go from there.</p>

                <p>I looked through your account history and you were indeed correct. Your mute count should be at 8, not 11. It looks like when you requested your year long mute we had to add a few to your account. When it was removed, the account was just unmuted without removing the extra mutes that were originally applied.</p>
<p>Because mute 8 is set to be a week long, I have unmuted your accounts as you've been muted for longer than that already. The next mute is 9 which is also a week, and 10 is a month, but you still need to be careful with that. </p>
<p>I would also recommend you check for Ban/mute decay. I don't think you currently fit the criteria to have anything reduced, but it should let you know the next time you're able to have any bans or mutes removed. You can do that here:</p>
