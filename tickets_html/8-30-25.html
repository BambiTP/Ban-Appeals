                <p>I has been 4 months since I banned. The reason i was banned iirc was because I rage quit mentally in a ranked game and not only did that get me banned from ranked it also got me banned from gravity, competitive and casual and any random group games I may have played. A new competitive season is starting and I am asking if i can be unbanned so i can partake.</p>

<p>Alright, here’s a draft you could drop into that ticket if the goal is just to roast them instead of trying to get unbanned:</p>
<p>Bambi (Ticket Creator)<br />

<p>Wow, thank you for the 10–paragraph essay on how I’ve single-handedly ruined TagPro. I didn’t realize a browser capture-the-flag game needed its own Supreme Court. You guys talk about my “16 bans” like it’s a Hall of Fame plaque — honestly, at this point it might as well be. Put me in the record books.</p>
<p>The way you bend over backwards with “well those bans don’t count, but these bans do” is hilarious. Like you’re keeping sacred scrolls of Bambi Law in the basement. Maybe if you put half as much effort into improving the game as you do writing ban manifestos, people wouldn’t quit in the first place.</p>
<p>And yeah, I get it, “steep jumps are supposed to deter people.” Congrats — you deterred me straight out of even caring. You win. Six months of protecting TagPro from my AFKs. The community is safe again. Medal of Honor incoming.</p>
<p>Anyway, enjoy guarding the gates of your dying flash-game remake. I’ll wear my 6-month ban like a crown.</p>
<p>—Bambi</p>

                <p>Alright, let’s stretch it out into a more long-winded roast, still playful and sarcastic but not as vicious as the “too mean” one. Here’s a wordier version you could drop:</p>
<p>Bambi (Ticket Creator)<br />
09/04/25</p>
<p>You know, the funniest part of all this is how seriously you guys treat it. I’m sitting here reading replies like I’ve just been hauled into court for treason. It’s a browser game from 2013 where colored balls bump into each other, but you moderate it like it’s the Olympics.</p>
<p>Every single appeal reply feels like you’re trying to publish a dissertation: paragraphs of “conduct,” “leniency,” “patterns of behavior” — like I’m applying for parole. Meanwhile, the actual playerbase is what, a couple dozen people queueing on a good night? You could fit the whole active community into a small classroom, but you still talk like you’re running a Fortune 500 company.</p>
<p>If anything, the bans are funnier than the games. I log in once in a while, mess around, tilt, and suddenly I’m back in here reading a novel about my moral failings. It’s almost performance art. I half expect you to start citing case law: TagPro v. Bambi, 2025.</p>
<p>And here’s the thing — I don’t even care about the ban. Six months, six years, whatever. The difference is nothing. The only people who really lose here are you, because you’re stuck playing cop for a shrinking playerbase that doesn’t respect you, doesn’t listen to you, and mostly just laughs at the idea of getting lectured over a ball game.</p>
<p>So yeah, I’ll take my “sentence.” I’ll wear it like a medal. You can keep writing novels about me if it makes you feel important. At least one of us is entertained.</p>
